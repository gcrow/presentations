# Presentations 
## Description

This page contains the presentations I've given or been involved in since 2021, along with links therein.

While I have spoken numerious times in various countries for ISSA, for Counter Terror Expo, at my local dc4420 and for various security events, these have historically been under Chatham House and to be honest, aren't worth reposting here anyhow.

In the future this section may also contain papers, should I release any.
